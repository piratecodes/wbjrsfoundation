                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            Humanity has been working diligently since the beginning of science to solve every mystery that has enveloped this universe. With technological advancements advancing at a breakneck speed, we must take a step back and ask ourselves, "What is our contribution to this?" Are we providing the tools necessary for the next generation to become the next great explorer or scientist?
<br>
The International Science Olympiad is specifically designed to accomplish this. The International Science Olympiad strives to identify raw talent among students in their earliest years. It's provides students with the opportunity to compete against the best on a global scale.</p>                      
<h3>Objective</h3>
The exam is designed to assess students' knowledge of the subject not just theoretically but also practically. The main aim of the exam is to test the scientific temperament of each student as they tackle problems of increasing difficulty that challenge their knowledge at every step and force them to think beyond their textbook knowledge. Each question is intended to assess each student's inherent knowledge.
